This webpage is designed to calculate the variable involved in object thrown vertically upward under the influence of gravity.
In addition, it also helps to simulate the overall motion of the body reflecting the maximum height reached, vellocity at 
different point of time, and the time took by the body to reach the maximum height as well as reaching back to the ground.
